#### Assignment-1: Modeling Early Vision
Report has been attached inside Assignment-1 Folder
Below are the steps which were done
Step 1. Took two images as given by the Instructor and did some preprocessing on it.
Step 2 Created a DoG filter for emulating the lateral inhibition. Applied this filter on the images and recorded the results in report.
Step 3. Created oriented filters (0, 45, 90 and 135 degree) using gabor filter for detecting the oriented edges. This filter was applied on DoG filtered image.
Step 4. Superimposed the edge images by applying the WTA policy and normalization for reproducing the outlined image.

#### Assignment-2: Implementation of Bayesian network
Report has been attached inside Assignment-2 Folder
Step 1. Implemented the bayesian network as per the network graph, initial prior probability and conditional probability table given by the instructor.
Step 2. Kept some values default and observed the changes happening in the network. Changes have been recorded inside the report.
Step 3. Also, Explained the reason behind the changes

#### Assignment-3: Spatial Envelop Representation
Report has been attached inside Assignment-3 Folder
Step 1. Took 20 images as as given by the Instructor and did some preprocessing on it.
Step 2. Created a DoG filter for emulating the lateral inhibition as in Assignment 1. Applied this filter on the images and recorded the results in report.
Step 3. Computed the global edge histogram for (0, 45, 90, 135 and no edge as per the WTA policy).
Step 4. Observed the four oriented edge orientation maps and the corresponding histograms for a few forest and city images, and mentioned in report my findings and Observations
Step 5. Applied k-means clustering algorithm (Cluster size k=2) on the histograms, and showed the images in each cluster separately.
